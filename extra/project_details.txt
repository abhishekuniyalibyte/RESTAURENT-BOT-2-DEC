my project is to create a ai bot that will be a part of restaurant website. it will be conversation 
based that will make user feel like they are talking to a person not a bot. user can ask for veg, vegan, 
non veg food. bot can also ask for user mood so it can recommend food based on user mood. 
it will do menu ordering and tell about services.i will use groq api key to use llama 4 maverick for llm
for free. i will be working with backend developer which will handle django part.
i will use terminal not streamlit to run my code so it can later on merge with backend easily.
